`kcBlog` is a simple HTML static site generator (SSG) for markdown files, written in Python.

This project takes a directory of markdown files (`./input`), and generates a static website with HTML files (`./output`).

The generated website includes a table of contents for each markdown file, as well as site breadcrumb navigation.

These files can then be served from a static web hosting service, such as Cloudflare or Github Pages.
