## Utils

### [kcDevContainer](https://github.com/CaseyLabs/kcUtils/tree/main/utils/kcDevContainer)

Why rebuild your dev environment on every new machine, when you can build and enter into a
standardized dev container shell?

### [kcDocGen](https://github.com/CaseyLabs/kcUtils/tree/main/utils/kcDocGen)

A simple README generator for source code documentation. 

`kcdocgen` takes all comments that begin with `#|` from an input file, and writes 
the content out to a README file. This allows you to write Markdown documentation 
directly in your source code.  

### [kcShell](https://github.com/CaseyLabs/kcUtils/tree/main/utils/kcShell)

A collection of shell script helper functions to simplify common commands and script writing.
